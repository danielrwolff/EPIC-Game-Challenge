# EPIC-Game-Challenge
McMaster first year engineering EPIC Game Challenge.

This is my submission to McMaster University's EPIC Game Challenge for first year engineering students. 

This game is called "Super Smash Sticks Brawl" - a remake of the popular Nintendo series "Super Smash Bros".
The aim of the game is to punch and kick your opponent (another player) until he/she falls off the map or reaches 300% damage. The more damaged a player is, the farther they will launch when attacked. The controls for the game are given within the game. Options such as game volume, lefty/righty modes, etc will be made at a later date. Currently you must have a friend to play this game with, as there is no AI.

Enjoy!
